# Atlas application-usecase example

This example proves the reusable UI capability needed by the Live Agent Organization Atlas application.

```text
AtlasApp     = AppSourceAdapter + SharedAtlasUI
AtlasExample = FixtureAdapter   + SharedAtlasUI
```

Both consumers pack and execute the same `packages/control/atlas-ui.mjs` screen, the same Live Atlas read-model/projection, and the same semantic-map/maxGraph primitives. The fixture adapter never copies the screen.

## Exact input

`input/example.jsonl` is a one-line deterministic fixture record containing:

- actual `ui.liveAtlasInput.v1` snapshots;
- a small accepted history with a revision gap;
- example-only scripted connection/snapshot steps with explicit times;
- provenance stating that this is synthetic UI evidence, not OCI activity or business authority.

The small dataset is intentionally chosen to retain the observable application-usecase capabilities: hierarchy, actor/org/member relations, work/parallel/status, references, Control/claim/pin, Inspector, search/audit, history/timeline, camera/LOD, UNKNOWN and recovery.

## Build

```sh
node scripts/build-live-atlas.mjs \
  --consumer=example \
  --input=examples/atlas/input/example.jsonl \
  --out=examples/atlas/dist
```

Generated output:

```text
examples/atlas/dist/
├─ index.html
└─ receipt.json
```

`dist/` is generated review output, ignored by Git and never source authority.

## Use

Open `dist/index.html` directly or through the repository's existing static host.

The shared Atlas screen starts on the deterministic sample history. Use **Next scripted update** to step through:

1. accepted/current live revision;
2. rejected update → UNKNOWN while the previous accepted revision is retained;
3. disconnected → UNKNOWN;
4. reconnect while the rejected attempt is still visible;
5. accepted recovery → current.

This bounded replay does not open EventSource and does not imply a real OCI producer.

## Capability evidence

| Application-usecase capability | Example action/evidence |
|---|---|
| hierarchy / org / membership | nested scopes plus actors/org/member rows; membership edge at non-far focused selection |
| work / state / refs | parallel running work, blocked/residual work, missing scope, purpose/policy refs |
| SVG + HTML selection | maxGraph activation and scope/audit controls converge on the same selected id/focus |
| Inspector / Control | scope/actor/work/evidence plus one real Control/claim/pin join |
| search / audit | raw source rows, unknown producer property search, exact-id selection |
| history / timeline | revision slider, gap, create/activity change, ref retarget and topology/status change |
| camera / LOD | Fit, wheel zoom, pan, far→middle→near, near work evidence |
| currentness | current, rejected/disconnected UNKNOWN, accepted recovery |
| closure | offline single-file module closure using the same SharedAtlasUI subset as the app artifact |

Large-scale 300-scope/readability/budget/rollback and real EventSource transport remain shared/application regression tests; the example does not duplicate those workloads.
